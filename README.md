## :computer: Project

The project is about creating a payroll system that manages employee payments and data, ensuring correct wages and deducting fees and taxes. There are three types of employees: hourly employees (paid by the hour and overtime, every Friday), salaried employees (fixed monthly salary, last working day of the month), and salaried commission employees (fixed salary plus commissions, every two Fridays) . Payment methods include mailed check, cash check or bank deposit. The system also manages variable union dues and deducts additional dues as needed. Payroll is processed daily according to the date entered.
